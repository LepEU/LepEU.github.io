By the end of 2024, Project Psyche expects to generate 1000 genomes of European Lepidoptera, with a goal of sequencing nearly all 11,000 within the coming 5 to 10 years.\nLepEU is focused upon using these emerging genomes to gain insights into the patterns of local adaption across Europe, exploring how species adapt across latitudes, elevation, and through seasons. We are currently focused upon field collections and will move into data generation in the fall of 2024 for our currently targets species. Our aim is to generate individual level re-sequencing data for diverse populations that are of shared interest to LepEU members."
